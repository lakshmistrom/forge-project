1st string translated to using the decimal decoder:
Voiceless it cries, Wingless flutters, Toothless bites, Mouthless mutters
-The answer to the riddle above is (The Wind. = 84 + 104 + 101+ 32 + 87 + 105 + 110 + 100 + 46 = 769).

2nd string translated to hexadecimal decoder: 
The sum the total of the ascii values from each letter in the answer to the riddle

3rd string translated to using the decimal decoder: 
2JI6"B6U#5-7.A$670.AÄºB6A&67,56B6_!6U#57,.

-Couldn't find the key to decript the last string.
